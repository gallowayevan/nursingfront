## Overarching
By 2033, North Carolina faces an estimated shortage of nearly 12,500 registered nurses and slightly more than 5,000 LPNs.

## Employment Setting Projections

RNs

-   The largest numeric shortfalls for RNs will occur in hospitals where
    demand will exceed supply by nearly 10,000 positions by 2033.

-   The second largest projected shortage of RNs in absolute numbers and
    the largest shortage as the percent of the workforce will occur in
    nursing home, extended care, and assisted living facilities.

LPNs

-   Nursing home, extended care, and assisted living facilities employ
    the greatest number of LPNs and these settings face a nearly 50%
    forecasted shortage of LPNs by 2033.

-   As LPNs leave hospital employment, hospitals will also face a large
    percentage shortfall (31.7%) of LPNs by 2033.

## Regional Projections

-   Most regions of the state are projected to face RN shortages except
    for the Southeast region; all regions will face LPN shortages.

-   Large metropolitan areas face significantly higher RN shortages than
    non-metro areas; both metro and non-metro areas face similar levels
    of LPN shortages.

-   Wake AHEC (including Raleigh-Durham) and Northwest AHEC (including
    Winston-Salem) face the largest RN shortages.

-   The Mountain AHEC (western NC) and Wake AHEC face the largest LPN
    shortages

## NC Nursecast models alternative, "what if" scenarios and how they change the baseline model predictions

Scenarios Likely to Increase Nurse Shortage

-   **What if nurses exit the workforce 2 years early?**

    -   The shortage worsens to 16,700 RNs by 2033

    -   The shortage worsens to 5,500 LPNs by 2033

-   **What if nurses exit the workforce 5 years early?**Â 

    -   The shortage worsens to more than 21,000 RNs by 2033

    -   The shortage increases to 6,000 LPNs by 2033

-   **What if the supply of out of state nurses decreases by 2.5%?**

    -   The shortage of worsens to 14,400 RNs by 2033

    -   The shortage worsens to 5,250 LPNs by 2033

Scenarios Likely to Improve or Decrease Nurse Shortage

-   **What if nurses remain in the workforce two years longer than
    expected?**

    -   The RN shortage improves from 12,500 to 11,500 by 2033

    -   The LPN shortage remains similar from 5,000 to 4,900 by 2033

-   **What if the number of nurse graduates increases by 10%?**

    -   The RN shortage improves slightly from 12,500 to 10,000 by 2033

    -   NC faces a similar shortage of LPNs from 5,000 at the baseline
        to 4,500 by 2033

> **Takeaway:** It will require a combination of increasing graduate
> supply, retaining current nurses, and possibly recruiting nurses that
> have left the workforce to address projected shortages.

**What about COVID?** We do not know the effect that COVID will have on
the supply and demand of nurses in NC. Reports of burnout, nurses
shifting to travel positions for higher pay, nurses returning to work,
students wanting to become nurses, and other factors will affect future
nursing supply and demand. If we balance early exits from the nurse
workforce and increased competition from other states with increased
enrollment in nursing programs:

-   The RN shortage worsens from 12,500 to 18,600 by 2033
-   The LPN shortage worsens from 5,000 to 5,800 by 2033
