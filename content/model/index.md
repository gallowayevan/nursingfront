<span class="has-text-weight-semibold">NC Nursecast</span> is an interactive, web-based tool that forecasts the future supply and demand for Registered Nurses (RNs) and Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs) in various practice settings in North Carolina. The tool draws on historical data from the NC Board of Nursing/Health Professions Data System, population data from the NC Office of Budget and Analysis, and expert input from an advisory committee to provide baseline estimates of how many nurses NC will have and how many nurses will be demanded in NC by region and by setting. The model also provides alternative scenarios to explore the potential outcome if nurses leave practice earlier than expected, if more students graduate from nursing programs, or if fewer nurses come to NC from out of state.  

If you'd like to learn more about how to use the model, you can look at our [brief written guide](#how-to-use) or watch the video below.

Otherwise, scroll down to the boxes below and select whether youâ€™d like to see supply and demand together (as a % or an absolute number), or supply separately, or demand separately. From there the toolbar on the left-hand side of the screen offers you options regarding what you would like to see forecast in the model.
