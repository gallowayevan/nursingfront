North Carolina has dozens of nursing programs in the state. Some train licensed practical nurses (LPNs), some train registered nurses (RNs). Some schools award an associate's degree to potential RNs, while others award a bachelor's degree. Where do these nurses go after they have completed training and how do the patterns of graduate diffusion differ between different types of programs and individual programs?

To help answer those questions, we use licensure data to determine where a nurse completed their first nursing degree for licensure and where they were working two years later. Then we put those origin and destination points on a map for each of North Carolina's nursing programs. We also drew an ellipse around those points to indicate the spatial extent of approximately 2/3 of the graduates in our data, providing a rough idea of the diffusion of a school's graduates.
