## Introduction
NC Nursecast is the culmination of more than two
 years of development by the Cecil G. Sheps Center's Program on Health
 Workforce Research and Policy with funding from the North Carolina
 Board of Nursing.

 [NC Nursecast](https://ncnursecast.unc.edu/) consists of two
 parts:

>The [Supply & Demand Model](https://ncnursecast.unc.edu/model/)
 is an interactive, web-based tool that forecasts the future supply and
 demand for Registered Nurses (RNs) and Licensed Practical Nurses
 (LPNs) in various practice settings in North Carolina. The model is
 based on historical nurse licensure data, state population data,
 health care utilization data, and expert input from a nursing advisory
 committee. These sources were used to develop baseline estimates of
 how many nurses NC will have and how many nurses NC will require from
 2019-2033.

 >The [Graduate Diffusion
 Tool](https://ncnursecast.unc.edu/diffusion/) is a separate
 interactive, web-based tool that allows users to see where students in
 NC's nurse training program practice after graduating. The tool shows
 the percent of each program's graduates working in North Carolina, the
 percent employed in different settings, and the percent located in
 rural areas.

## What Makes NC Nursecast Unique
The model provides forecasts of North Carolina's future nurse workforce
 that can be accessed through an interactive website with customizable,
 downloadable data and visualizations (line charts, regional maps, and
 state graduate diffusion maps). The model offers users the ability to
 examine possible surpluses and shortages by nurse practice setting
 (hospital, home care/hospice, correctional facility, etc.) and region
 (Medicaid regions, AHEC regions, metro/nonmetro). The model also
 allows users to explore different "what if" scenarios that could alter
 the forecast. For example, what if nurses experience increased burnout
 and exit practice two years early or five years early? Conversely,
 what if more students enter nurse training programs?

 ## Key Findings
 By 2033, North Carolina faces an estimated
 shortage of nearly 12,500 registered nurses and slightly more than
 5,000 LPNs. Those projections represent an 11% shortfall for RNs and a
 27% shortfall for LPNs.

### Setting Findings

- The largest numeric shortfalls for RNs will occur in hospitals, where
demand could exceed supply by nearly 10,000 positions by 2033.

- Nursing home, extended care, and assisted living facilities employ
    the greatest number of LPNs and these settings face a nearly 50%
    forecasted shortage of LPNs by 2033.

“Expanding enrollment in nursing programs is important, but we also must focus on retention—cherishing our existing workforce—and recruiting nurses back into the profession.” <br>

### Region Findings


-   Most regions of the state are projected to face RN shortages except
    for the Southeast region; all regions are projected to face LPN
    shortages.



-   Large metropolitan areas face significantly higher RN shortages than
    non-metro areas; both metro and non-metro areas face similar levels
    of LPN shortages.



### "What if" Scenario Findings

-   If nurses were to leave the workforce five years earlier than past
    trends would predict, the nursing shortage would be significantly
    worsened---exceeding 21,000 RNs and 6,000 LPNs by 2033.

-   If these early exits from the nurse workforce are combined with
    increased competition for nurses from other states, but also offset
    somewhat by increased enrollment in nursing programs, the net effect
    would be a shortage of over 18,000 RNs and nearly 6,000 LPNs.

### Graduate Diffusion Findings

-   NC nursing programs produce graduates who practice locally,
    especially in the Southeast. Use our [Graduate Diffusion
    Tool](https://ncnursecast.unc.edu/diffusion/) to see
    school-specific graduate "footprints."

## Policy Options

 Although increasing nursing program enrollments alone will not solve
 workforce shortages, increasing funding of nursing programs, raising
 faculty wages so they can better compete with clinical salaries, and
 addressing the shortage of preceptors in the state can help increase
 supply. The good news is that investments in nursing programs yield a
 high return on investment, with high graduate retention (Table 1).
