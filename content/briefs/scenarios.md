## NC Nursecast's Baseline Model.

Like most workforce projection models, NC Nursecast uses historical data
on the supply and demand of Registered Nurses (RNs) and Licensed
Practical Nurses (LPNs) to forecast the future. This approach produces a
“baseline model” that assumes trends in the supply and demand for nurses
will remain the same in the future. This assumption is easily challenged
given the rapid pace of health system change, new payment and care
delivery models, and the significant impact that the pandemic and other
“shocks” will have on the nursing workforce. However, a solid baseline
model, derived from strong data, rigorous methods, and expert nursing
input, provides a foundation from which to simulate how future changes
such as early (or delayed) exit from the workforce, rising nursing
enrollments, and increased competition for out-of-state nurses may
affect future nursing supply.

NC Nursecast uses nursing data from 2015 through 2018, derived from
[North Carolina Board of Nursing (NC BoN)](https://www.ncbon.com/) licensure files. This rich
source of information about RN and LPN supply, demographics, education,
practice location, and employment setting represent a complete census of
the workforce. A model built on licensure data, which provide a
particularly rich source of information on the supply of nurses in North
Carolina and their demographic, educational, and practice
characteristics, can provide more accurate projections than models that
draw on national data sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics and
the American Community Survey.[^1]

The availability of longitudinal data provides information about the
number of nurses entering the workforce in each year, whether new
graduates are from NC nursing programs or are moving to practice in NC
from out-of-state, and the probability, at different ages, that a nurse
will exit practice.

## Important Factors Influencing the Baseline Model.

North Carolina’s nursing workforce depends on importing nurses from
outside the state. Table 1 shows that more than one-half (56%) of new
RNs and more than one-third (38%) of new LPNs to the NC workforce each
year are from out-of-state. This makes the state vulnerable to
competition from other states as they also face shortages in the future.

Additionally, nurse forecasts are sensitive to changes in the number of
nurses exiting the workforce in each year. Even small changes in the
rate at which nurses exit the workforce can have a significant effect on
future supply.[^2] Figure 1 shows that the probability that an LPN or RN
will exit active practice is fairly steady from about the mid-30s to 60
years of age. After that, the probability of exiting increases
significantly in each year.


{{< figurecustom src="/images/scenarios_brief/image1.png" title="Figure 1. Probability of Leaving the Workforce within Two Years by Age, RNs and LPNs, North Carolina, 2011-2015" source="Source: NC Nursecast. https://ncnursecast.unc.edu/." alt="Line chart with two lines - one for registered nurses and one for licensed practical nurses. The y axis is the probability of leaving the workforce and the x axis is nurse age." >}}

## Creating ‘what if’ scenarios allows users to examine potential, different, futures.
Workforce models are often assumed to produce one
“answer” to the question: will RN and LPN supply meet demand in the
future for a given employment setting or geographic area?[^3] However,
nursing workforce participation patterns, models of care, and other
factors are likely to change in the future. NC Nursecast was developed
using data captured before COVID-19 emerged and while we know the
pandemic will affect nursing supply and demand in the future, these
effects are not yet well understood.

To account for potential changes that cannot be known at the time
forecasts are developed, workforce modelers often create “what if”
scenarios that allow users to explore what may happen if previous trends
change. These shifts could occur for a variety of reasons, including the
COVID-19 pandemic. For example, increased burnout, vaccine mandates and
the growing demand for travel nurses could increase attrition from the
workforce. An alternative scenario is that the pandemic triggers a
“nurse hero” effect which increases the number of students applying to
nursing school.[^4] Scenarios simulate possible futures even though there
is no actual way to know what the “true” future may be.

NC Nursecast models five alternative scenarios to demonstrate the effects
that changes in workforce exit, out-of-state-supply, and numbers of new
graduates could have on the nurse workforce in the future. These five
alternatives include:

> 1\. Early exit from the workforce by 2 years: nurses leave the
> workforce two years earlier than they would have based on historical
> data, with all nurses retiring by age 68
>
> 2\. Early exit from the workforce by 5 years: nurses leave the
> workforce five years earlier than they would have based on historical
> data, with all nurses retiring by age 65
>
> 3\. Delayed exit from the workforce by 2 years: nurses delay leaving
> the workforce by two years beyond historical data, although all nurses still retire by age 70
>
>4\. Reduction in out-of-state nurse supply by 2.5%
>
>5\. Increase in NC new graduate nurse supply by 10%

We also modeled a sixth scenario that combines three of the five
scenarios above and reflects a combination of effects that could occur
together, given some early indicators of the current NC nursing
environment and the COVID-19 pandemic:

> 6\. Combined scenario: nurses exit the workforce five years earlier
> than they would have based on historical data, with all nurses retiring by age 65 + a reduction
> in out-of-state supply by 2.5% + an increase in NC new graduate supply by
> 10%

### What the scenarios help illuminate about NC’s future nursing forecast
The baseline model shows that even before the effects of the
pandemic or other possible scenarios are considered, North Carolina
faced a shortage of nearly 12,500 RNs. Below, we explore how each of the
"what if" scenarios changes the baseline model forecast for Registered
Nurses. Important note: NC Nursecast can be used to generate all the same
“what if” forecasts for Licensed Practical Nurses, but for illustrative
purposes we have focused on RNs in this brief.

**If nurses exit 5 years early:** The baseline shortage is significantly
worsened—to exceed 21,000 RNs—if nurses leave the workforce five years
earlier (Figure 2).

{{< figurecustom src="/images/scenarios_brief/image2.png" title="Figure 2. RN Supply and Demand under Baseline Model vs. RNs Exiting Workforce Five Years Earlier." source="Source: NC Nursecast. https://ncnursecast.unc.edu/model." alt="Line chart with a pair of lines (supply and demand) for each projection. The y axis is nurse headcount and the x axis is time (year)." >}}


**If the number of nurse graduates increases by 10%:** Faculty and
preceptor shortages in North Carolina, along with limited clinical site
availability and physical space capacity, limit the number of students
that can be admitted to nursing programs. Given these challenges, it is
not likely that NC will be able to dramatically increase nursing program
enrollments. However, even if the state could achieve a 10% increase in
new graduate nurse supply, it will do very little to offset the
projected shortage. Figure 3 shows that with a 10% increase in nursing program
graduates, NC still faces a shortage of over 10,000 nurses in 2033.
These findings highlight the importance of investing in efforts to
retain the current NC nurse workforce rather than assuming that growth
in the number of nursing program graduates will address emerging workforce
shortfalls.

RN Supply and Demand under Baseline Model vs. 10% Increase in New Nurse Graduate Supply" source="Source: NC Nursecast. https://ncnursecast.unc.edu/model." alt="Line chart with a pair of lines (supply and demand) for each projection. The y axis is nurse headcount and the x axis is time (year)." >}}


While we won’t know the outcome of COVID on the NC nurse workforce for a
long time, we can simulate how multiple scenarios might combine to
affect the workforce. If we balance early exits from the nurse workforce
and increased competition from other states (reducing our ability to
import nurses from outside NC) with increased enrollment in nursing
programs, the net effect is a shortage of over 18,000 RNs.

RN Supply and Demand under Baseline Model vs. RNs Exiting Workforce 5 Years Earlier + Out-of-State Supply Reduced by 2.5% + 10% Increase in New Nurse Graduate Supply" source="Source: NC Nursecast. https://ncnursecast.unc.edu/model." alt="Line chart with a pair of lines (supply and demand) for each projection. The y axis is nurse headcount and the x axis is time (year)." >}}


## Customizing Scenarios to Different Settings and Regions.

This brief has highlighted how the supply and demand of RNs might change
under different scenarios at the state level. The model could be used to make these same projections for LPNs. NC Nursecast allows users to see how these
different scenarios would affect different regions and employment
settings. This is an important feature of NC Nursecast because, for
example, the workforce in one region of the state or in one employment
setting may have an older workforce that would be more significantly
impacted by early workforce exit than state averages would reveal. Some
employment settings also may rely more on out-of-state nurses, and some
geographic areas may be more or less likely to retain their nursing program 
graduates. The power of NC Nursecast is the ability to see how these
regional and employment setting differences play out under different
possible “futures.”
