<span id="aprn-definition">Advanced Practice Registered Nurse, APRN</span>
: A registered nurse who has completed master's level training in a specialty. APRNs include nurse practitioner, certified nurse midwives, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and clinical nurse specialists. APRNs are excluded from the registered nurse supply in the [supply](#supply-definition) model.

<span id="ahec-definition">Area Health Education Center (AHEC) Regions</span>
: North Carolina's [Area Health Education Center Program](https://www.ncahec.net/) is a statewide program to develop the state's healthcare workforce, which is administered through nine regions made up of adjacent counties. Each region has its own AHEC center focussed on the unique workforce needs of the region.

<span id="current-workforce-definition">Current workforce</span>
: The LPNs and RNs in active practice in North Carolina in 2018.

<span id="demand-definition">Demand</span>
: The amount of a particular type of service consumed (or predicted to be consumed by the population). In the model, demand is defined by the types of services provided by registered nurses or licensed practical nurses. 

<span id="diffusion-definition">Diffusion</span>
: The modeled the geographic migration of new entrants from their place of education to their first job and the movement of actively practicing nurses by concatenating multiple years of licensure data. The model also accounted for changes in employment (settings)(#setting-definition) of the nurse workforce.

<span id="fte-definition">Full Time Equivalent, FTE</span>
: One of two ways to count a workforce. Each nurse is counted as a proportion of full-time based on the number of hours they work. Our model defines full time as 40 hours per week. For example, a nurse may only work as a nurse for 4 hours per day on Monday through Thursday, a total of 16 hours and an FTE of 0.4 (16/40). The other way to count is by headcount. We modeled FTE in the probabilistic model based on the mean and standard deviation of hours worked as a function of age, gender, specialty and employment [setting](#setting-definition) using NCBON licensure files which contain self-reported average hours worked per week in nursing. See [headcount](#headcount-definition).

<span id="headcount-definition">Headcount</span>
: One of two ways to count a workforce. Each nurse is counted as 1.0 regardless of whether they are full or part time. The other way to count is by [full time equivalent](#fte-definition).

<span id="joiners-definition">Joiners</span>
: Nurses who are predicted to join the workforce in a given year. These are nurses who recently graduated, moved to North Carolina from another state, or re-entered the workforce after an absence.

<span id="leavers-definition">Leavers</span>
: Nurses who are predicted to leave the workforce in a given year. These are nurses who exited the workforce due to retirement, death, moving to inactive status and leaving practice in NC. The probability of exiting the workforce was modeled using a logistic regression that examined the effect of the nurse's gender, age, employment [setting](#setting-definition) and highest degree.

<span id="lpn-definition">Licensed Practical Nurse, LPN</span>
: A nurse who has completed one year of postsecondary education and clinical training. LPNs must be supervised in their scope of practice by RNs, APRNs, or physicians. LPN scope of practice is dependent and focused. 

<span id="medicaid-region-definition">Medicaid Region</span>
: North Carolina is in the process of transitioning to a managed care model for its Medicaid program. To administer the program, the NC Department of Health and Human Services has divided the state into five regions. Forecasting demand at this level is particularly useful when looking at the [demand](#demand-definition) of the Medicaid beneficiary population.

<span id="metropolitan-definition">Metropolitan</span>
: A county that contains a core urban area of 50,000 or more people, as defined by the United States Census Bureau and the Office of Management and Budget. Typically, this designation is used to define counties that are urban or not rural. This model uses the 2017 vintage of the county delineation file in which 46 counties in North Carolina are metropolitan. See [nonmetropolitan](#nonmetropolitan-definition).

<span id="microsimulation-definition">Microsimulation</span>
: A technique for modeling individual behaviors that affect the workforce [supply](#supply-definition) including, for example, the uncertainty of age of retirement. This approach relies on multiple iterations of probabilities that, when repeatedly run, produce not only an average (mean) estimate of future [supply](#supply-definition) but also a range of uncertainty (confidence interval).

<span id="nonmetropolitan-definition">Nonmetropolitan</span>
: A county that does **not** contain a core urban area of 50,000 or more people, as defined by the United States Census Bureau and the Office of Management and Budget. Typically, this designation is used to define counties that are rural. This model uses the 2017 vintage of the county delineation file in which 54 counties in North Carolina are nonmetropolitan. See [metropolitan](#metropolitan-definition).

<span id="ncbon-definition">North Carolina Board of Nursing, NCBON</span>
: The board that licenses registered nurses and licensed practical nurses in the North Carolina. The licensure data provided by the board was used to generate the [supply](#supply-definition) model. The board was also the primary partner and funding source for this modeling project.

<span id="out-of-state-supply-definition">Out-of-State Supply</span>
: The number of nurses who annually enter the North Carolina workforce after completing their education outside of North Carolina or enter practice in NC after practicing in another state.

<span id="projected-future-workforce-definition">Projected future workforce</span>
: The forecast of the RN and LPN workforce for each future year derived from the previous year's workforce after removing leavers and adding joiners. This process was repeated annually to generate forecasts from 2019 until 2033.

<span id="rate-per-10k-population-definition">Rate per 10k Population</span>
: The number of nurses per 10,000 members of the general population for a geographic area. This rate provides a way to understand the number of nurses relative to the population they serve and to compare between areas with different populations. For instance, 10 registered nurses in Mecklenburg County (population: ~1 million) will have a different relative impact on the healthcare in the area than 10 registered nurses in Camden County (population: ~10,000).

<span id="re-entry-definition">Re-entry</span>
: When a nurse changes from inactive to active practice. That is, they have re-entered the workforce.

<span id="rn-definition">Registered Nurse, RN</span>
: A nurse who has typically completed either a two-year postsecondary degree (an Associate's Degree in Nursing, or ADN) or a four year postsecondary program (Bachelor of Science in Nursing, or BSN). The RN scope of practice does not require supervision â€“ an RN's practice is independent and comprehensive. In practice, RNs are often administratively supervised in work [settings](#setting-definition)  by other RNs, by APRNs, or possibly by physicians.

<span id="scenario-definition">Scenario</span>
: Different versions of the projected future workforce model that diverge from the baseline model in some way. The baseline model assumes that the factors affecting the [supply](#supply-definition) and [demand](#demand-definition) for nursing services will continue as they have in 2018. Yet we know that nursing workforce participation patterns, models of care and other factors are likely to change. For instance, a scenario could involve increasing the probability associated with a nurse retiring in a given year.

<span id="scope-of-practice-definition">Scope of practice</span>
: The statutory limits of a licensed professional's practice. The scope of practice for a given profession varies between states.

<span id="setting-definition">Setting</span>
: The work environment of a nurse. The setting is self-reported on NCBON licensure forms from a limited number of options. For instance, the most common setting for registered nurses is a hospital. 

<span id="shortage-definition">Shortage</span>
: A shortage occurs when [demand](#demand-definition) exceeds [supply](#supply-definition). The magnitude of the shortage can be described as an absolute number ("We have a shortage of 200 registered nurses.") or a relative value ("We have 80% of the nurses we need to meet the demand."). See [surplus](#surplus-definition).

<span id="supply-definition">Supply</span>
: The number of nurses available to meet the [demand](#demand-definition) for services. The supply can be enumerated as either headcount or FTE.

<span id="surplus-definition">Surplus</span>
: A surplus occurs when [supply](#supply-definition) exceeds [demand](#demand-definition). The magnitude of the surplus can be described as an absolute number ("We have a surplus of 100 registered nurses.") or a relative value ("We have 20% more nurses than needed to meet the demand."). See [shortage](#shortage-definition).
